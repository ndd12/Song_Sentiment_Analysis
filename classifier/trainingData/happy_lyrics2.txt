Planes to Rome and ships to Spain China sunsets, jungle silver with rain But what a fool I would be To leave heaven, no not me But all this world and the seven seas.  Couldn't call me away if I could stay In these arms holding me...

Whenever my head starts to hurt Before it goes from bad to feeling worst I turn off my phone I get down low I put my hands in the dirt  I try to stop the world from moving so fast Try and get a grip on where I'm at To simplify this daisy life And get my feet in the grass  I'm going back to the Earth I'm going back to the Earth I'm going back to work I'm going back to the Earth Yes I'm going Back...  The only explanation for our rise Must be that everybody wants to get it high  Move on up to a[?] Up on in the sky[?]  The higher we go, the taller we grow old We lose sight of our land below You can have your place up in outer space Cause my home is where my food is grown  I'm going back to the Earth I'm going back to the Earth I'm going back to work I'm going back to the Earth (X2)  We are animals (we are animals) We are wild (we are wild) And we'll start with emotions at the bottom of the ocean I was feeling from the top of the trees  We are animals (we are animals) We are wild (we are wild)  And we'll truly be forgiven when we start getting back to living With the land in harmony  I'm going back to the earth I'm going back to the earth Oh yeah,  I listen to the whistle in the wind It's blending with the songs of the birds The messages remind me who I am That I'm a child of the Earth  It's where I find spirituality It's in everything that surrounds me You can spell God G-O-D Or you can spell it N-A-T-U-R-E  I'm going back to the Earth I'm going back to the Earth I'm going back to work I'm going back to the Earth I'm going Back!

Are you lonely where you are? Sitting in your car waiting for someone you know to pass. Strangers never stop to ask if you're alright.  You hate the way the world Has become so impersonal No seems to care if you're even there.  The music moves so slowly, Just below your heartbeat. You chose these songs specifically To help you sleep.  Does anyone really miss anyone anymore? Friends we never see, And we do our best to ignore. Ex-lovers we cross the street just to avoid.  And here they come. They are silent in the air, And if they weren't breathing, You wouldn't even notice they were there. They want you to know That when one chapter ends Another begins. So let it begin.  Your story goes on and on and on.

Slow your lovin' up Slow your lovin' down  Love gaining not losin' ground. No worry No hurry Take your sweet time Baby. Dabble dally Shilly shally Slow down this ain't a race car rally  Bit by bit Inch by inch Cool your heels We're hangin' fire.  That's the way That's the way That's our love in slow motion  That's the way Like the way That's our love in slow motion.  Strolling when we walk Whisper when we talk  Grass growing right up under our feet. Oh stay Lover Delay Lover Take a little more time with me.  That's the way That's the way That's our love in slow motion ...  Slow down greased lightning Make love Gentle not frightening  Deep down devotion That's our love in slow motion.  Lighten up and lay your rocket down  Little by little Not in leaps and bounds. Ride at anchor restin' on your oars  A little laissez-fair Honey More More More More!  That's the way That's the way That's our love in slow motion ...

I was tired of my lady, we'd been together too long Like a worn out recording of a favorite song So while she lay there sleeping, I read the paper in bed And in the personal columns, there was this letter I read  "If you like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain If you're not into yoga, if you have half a brain If you like making love at midnight in the dunes on the cape Then I'm the love that you've looked for, write to me and escape"  I didn't think about my lady, I know that sounds kind of mean But me and my old lady had fallen into the same old dull routine So I wrote to the paper, took out a personal ad And though I'm nobody's poet, I thought it wasn't half bad  "Yes, I like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain I'm not much into health food, I am into champagne I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon and cut through all this red tape At a bar called O'Malley's where we'll plan our escape"  So I waited with high hopes and she walked in the place I knew her smile in an instant, I knew the curve of her face It was my own lovely lady and she said, "Aw, it's you" Then we laughed for a moment and I said, "I never knew"  That you like piña coladas and gettin' caught in the rain And the feel of the ocean and the taste of champagne If you like making love at midnight in the dunes on the cape You're the lady I've looked for, come with me and escape  If you like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain If you're not into yoga, if you have half a brain If you like making love at midnight in the dunes on the cape Then I'm the love that you've looked for, write to me and escape  Yes, I like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain I'm not much into health food, I am into champagne I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon and cut through all this red tape At a bar called O'Malley's where we'll plan our escape

Hold me close and hold me fast The magic spell you cast, this is la vie en rose  When you kiss me heaven sighs And though I close my eyes I see la vie en rose  When you press me to your heart I'm in a world apart, a world where roses bloom  And when you speak angels sing from above Everyday words seems, to turn into love songs  Give your heart and soul to me And life will always be la vie en rose

I used to rule the world Seas would rise when I gave the word Now in the morning I sleep alone Sweep the streets I used to own  I used to roll the dice Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes Listen as the crowd would sing "Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"  One minute I held the key Next the walls were closed on me And I discovered that my castles stand Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing Roman Cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field  For some reason I can't explain Once you'd gone there was never Never an honest word And that was when I ruled the world  It was the wicked and wild wind Blew down the doors to let me in Shattered windows and the sound of drums People couldn't believe what I'd become  Revolutionaries wait For my head on a silver plate Just a puppet on a lonely string Oh who would ever want to be king?  I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field  For some reason I can't explain I know Saint Peter won't call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world  I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field  For some reason I can't explain I know Saint Peter won't call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world
I need love, love To ease my mind I need to find, find someone to call mine But mama said  You can't hurry love No, you just have to wait She said love don't come easy It's a game of give and take  You can't hurry love No, you just have to wait You got to trust, give it time No matter how long it takes  But how many heartaches Must I stand before I find a love To let me live again Right now the only thing That keeps me hangin' on When I feel my strength, yeah It's almost gone I remember mama said:  You can't hurry love No, you just have to wait She said love don't come easy It's a game of give and take  How long must I wait How much more can I take Before loneliness will cause my heart Heart to break?  No I can't bear to live my life alone I grow impatient for a love to call my own But when I feel that I, I can't go on These precious words keeps me hangin' on I remember mama said:  You can't hurry love No, you just have to wait She said love don't come easy It's a game of give and take  You can't hurry love No, you just have to wait She said trust, give it time No matter how long it takes  No, love, love don't come easy But I keep on waiting Anticipating for that soft voice To talk to me at night For some tender arms To hold me tight I keep waiting I keep on waiting But it ain't easy It ain't easy But mama said:  You can't hurry love No, you just have to wait She said to trust, give it time No matter how long it takes  You can't hurry love No, you just have to wait She said love don't come easy It's a game of give and take (repeat and fade)

Feeling my way through the darkness Guided by a beating heart I can't tell where the journey will end But I know where to start  They tell me I'm too young to understand They say I'm caught up in a dream My life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes So that's fine by me  So wake me up when it's all over When I'm wiser and I'm older All this time I was finding myself And I didn't know I was lost  So wake me up when it's all over When I'm wiser and I'm older All this time I was finding myself And I didn't know I was lost  I tried carrying the weight of the world But I only have two hands Hope I get the chance to travel the world But I don't have any plans  Wish that I could stay forever this young Not afraid to close my eyes Life's a game made for everyone And love is the prize  So wake me up when it's all over When I'm wiser and I'm older All this time I was finding myself And I didn't know I was lost  So wake me up when it's all over When I'm wiser and I'm older All this time I was finding myself And I didn't know I was lost  I didn't know I was lost I didn't know I was lost I didn't know I was lost I didn't know I was lost

Well I ran in to some trouble and headed out toward Liberty Line. I heard voices going in my head, "you could be livin' more than you could be dyin'." I remember when we fell in love; you were the one I thought I'd never meet. I taste your words on the tip of my tongue; they were soft and they were sweet. But we ran into some trouble; we knew our love was slowly dyin' And when we said the words that ended us, I headed out toward Liberty Line. The night was some kind of quiet; I could almost hear myself think. I felt my heart was like a heavy flood; I'm gonna float or I'm gonna sink. I was thinking we could settle down, start a family, and start a life. I was only two days short of asking you if you would be my wife. But we ran into some trouble, we met that enemy that we call time. Threw my guitar in the back of my car and headed out toward Liberty Line.  I didn't know what would be waiting there. I didn't know what I would find. But I knew I had to make it, make it to Liberty Line.  They say you can't see the forest when you're there among the trees. They say it takes a separation to find some kind of clarity. But I feel I'm gonna make it to the line where freedom waits, And then this lonely prisoner can cross the border to a better state. Now I'm on my last stretch of road, and I don't know what I'm gonna find. Maybe the sheriff will be waiting there and stop me short of Liberty Line. Off in the distance, I'm coming closer with every breath, I see a woman staring back at me. I stop the car. She comes up on my left. She said, "I didn't know if you would make it see, I got this enemy that I call time, But I was wondering could I hitch a ride, by the way my name is Liberty Line."  I didn't know what would be waiting there. I didn't know what I would find. But I knew I had to make it, make it to Liberty Line.

Go Go Johnny go! Go Go Johnny go! Go Go Johnny go! Go Johnny B. Goode!  His mother told him, "Someday you will be a man, And you will be the leader of a big ol' band Many people comin' from miles around To hear you play your music when the sun go down Maybe someday your name'll be in lights Sayin' 'Johnny B. Goode tonight!'"  Go go Go Johnny go! Go go go Johnny go! Go go go Johnny go! Go go go Johnny go! Go Johnny B. Goode!

I'm packed and I'm holding I'm smiling, she's living She's golden, she lives for me Says she lives for me Ovation, her own motivation She comes 'round and she goes down on me  And I make her smile like a drug for you Do ever what you want to do, coming over you Keep on smiling, what we go through One stop to the rhythm that divides you  And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse Chop another line like a coda with a curse Come on like a freak show takes the stage We give them the games we play, she said  I want something else To get me through this Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby I want something else I'm not listening when you say goodbye  The sky was gold, it was rose I was taking sips of it through my nose And I wish I could get back there Some place back there Smiling in the pictures you would take Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break  It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given And I bumped again and I bumped again I said  How do I get back there To the place where I fell asleep inside you? How do I get myself back to the place where you said  I want something else To get me through this Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby I want something else I'm not listening when you say goodbye  I believe in the sand beneath my toes The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling I believe in the faith that grows And the four right chords can make me cry When I'm with you I feel like I could die And that would be all right, all right  And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing The velvet, it rips in the city We tripped on the urge to feel alive Now I'm struggling to survive  Those days you were wearing that velvet dress You're the priestess, I must confess Those little red panties they pass the test Slide up around the belly, face down on the mattress  One, and you hold me And we are broken Still it's all that I want to do Just a little now  Feel myself hovering off the ground I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no no And I won't run for my life She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile But nothing is all right, all right  And I want something else to get me through this life, baby I want something else, not listening when you say Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye  The sky was gold, it was rose I was taking sips of it through my nose And I wish I could get back there Some place back there In the place we used to start  I want something else

You learn a couple things when you get to my age Like friends don't lie and it all tastes the same in the dark When your vinyl and your coffee collection is a sign of the times You're getting spiritually enlightened at 29  So just give yourself a try Won't you give yourself a try? Won't you give yourself a try? Won't you give?  I found a grey hair in one of my zoots Like context in a modern debate, I just took it out The only apparatus required for happiness is your pain and fucking going outside And getting STDs at 27 really isn't the vibe Jane took her own life at 16 She was a kid who had the box tattooed on her arm And I was 25 and afraid to go outside A millennial that baby-boomers like  Won't you give yourself a try? Won't you give yourself a try? Won't you give yourself a try? Won't you give?  And what would you say to your younger self? Growing a beard's quite hard And whiskey never starts to taste nice And you'll make a lot of money, and it's funny 'Cause you'll move somewhere sunny and get addicted to drugs And spend obscene amounts on fucking seeds and beans online  So just give yourself a try Won't you give yourself a try? Won't you give yourself a try? Won't you give?

A long, long time ago I can still remember how that music used to make me smile And I knew if I had my chance That I could make those people dance And maybe they'd be happy for a while  But February made me shiver With every paper I'd deliver Bad news on the doorstep I couldn't take one more step  I can't remember if I cried When I read about his widowed bride But something touched me deep inside The day the music died  So bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin' "This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die"  Did you write the book of love? And do you have faith in God above? If the Bible tells you so Now, do you believe in rock and roll? Can music save your mortal soul? And can you teach me how to dance real slow?  Well, I know that you're in love with him 'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm and blues  I was a lonely teenage bronkin' buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died  I started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin' "This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die"  Now for ten years we've been on our own And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone But that's not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me  Oh, and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned No verdict was returned  And while Lenin read a book on Marx A quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the dark The day the music died  We were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry  Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin' "This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die"  Helter skelter in a summer swelter The birds flew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and falling fast It landed foul on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast  Now the halftime air was sweet perfume While the sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh, but we never got the chance  'Cause the players tried to take the field The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died?  We started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin' "This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die"  Oh, and there we were all in one place A generation lost in space With no time left to start again So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick Jack Flash sat on a candlestick 'Cause fire is the devil's only friend  Oh, and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in Hell Could break that Satan's spell  And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died  He was singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin' "This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die"  I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store Where I'd heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldn't play  And in the streets, the children screamed The lovers cried and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken The church bells all were broken  And the three men I admire most The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died  And they were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin' "This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die"  They were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin' "This'll be the day that I die"

She was underwater In the shadows Was it there, was it not? I stepped back A veil in front of my eyes The water was still and so was she I dove in with so little breath In truth I knew I was too late for death I had one chance I grasped her arm and floated upwards Wanting to stay below in the warm forgiving waters What have you done I screamed to the stars Then over to the shallow edge She was face down Smaller and more vulnerable than in life Her curls wet around her ears and neck Her dear profile at peace at last A finger in her throat sounded a click Her body still and blue Is this what death looks like? My love was supposed to protect her It didn't My love was supposed to heal her It didn't You had said don't leave me And I begged you not to leave me We did.
I thought I saw a man brought to life He was warm, he came around and he was dignified He showed me what it was to cry  Well, you couldn't be that man I adored You don't seem to know, seem to care what your heart is for But I don't know him anymore  There's nothing where he used to lie The conversation has run dry That's what's goin' on Nothing's fine, I'm torn  I'm all out of faith This is how I feel I'm cold and I am shamed Lying naked on the floor Illusion never changed Into something real I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn You're a little late I'm already torn  So I guess the fortune teller's right Should have seen just what was there and not some holy light But you crawled beneath my veins and now  I don't care, I have no luck I don't miss it all that much There's just so many things That I can't touch, I'm torn  I'm all out of faith This is how I feel I'm cold and I am shamed Lying naked on the floor Illusion never changed Into something real I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn You're a little late I'm already torn Torn  There's nothing where he used to lie My inspiration has run dry That's what's goin' on Nothing's right, I'm torn  I'm all out of faith This is how I feel I'm cold and I am shamed Lying naked on the floor Illusion never changed Into something real I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn  I'm all out of faith This is how I feel I'm cold and I'm ashamed Bound and broken on the floor You're a little late  I'm already torn Torn (oh)  (Oh yeah, a little) (Oh yeah, a little) (Oh yeah, a little)
Every time that you get undressed I hear symphonies in my head I wrote this song just looking at you oh, oh Yet the drums they swing low And the trumpets they go  Da da, da ra ra da, da, da Da, ra, ra, ra, da, da Da da, da ra ra da, da, da Da, ra, ra, ra, da, da They go  Is it weird that I hear Violins whenever you're gone?

Take it slow but it's not typical He already knows that my love is fire His heart was a stone, but then his hands roam I turned him to gold and it took him higher But I'll be your day-dream, I'll be your favorite things We could be beautiful Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to Paradise Say you'll never let me go  Deep in my bones I can feel you Take me back to a time when we knew how to wait We could waste the night with an old film Smoke a little weed on my couch in the backroom hideaway Say you'll never let me go Say you'll never let me go  Say you'll never let me go Say you'll never let me go Say you'll never let me go  Say you'll never let me go  Deep in my bones I can feel you Take me back to a time when we knew how to wait We could waste the night with an old film Smoke a little weed on my couch in the backroom hideaway Say you'll never let me go Say you'll never let me go  Say you'll never let me go Say you'll never let me go
I should know better by now But it's twenty to two and you know that I want some Should be drinking 'em down  But he poisoned my mind any time that I'm on one  Every tomorrow I wake up and pray it's the day That I won't miss it or want it or need him to stay But he's already on his way You know the worse they are The better they taste  All my cravings come at me This ain't love, it's sacrifice Oh my God, I can't behave The worse they are, the better they taste  I got a big appetite If I look then I touch then it's already over I wish I could just take a bite So I do, I don't think I can sink any lower  Every tomorrow, I wake up and pray I won't be 'Caught in the sugar, your sour, your salty, your sweet I'm starving, so give it to me You know the worse they are The better they'll be  All my cravings come at me This ain't love, it's sacrifice Oh my God, I can't behave The worse they are The better they taste  One little bite couldn't hurt, right? I'ma get what I deserve, right? I'm done with playing it safe You know the worse they are The better they taste  All my cravings come at me This ain't love, it's sacrifice Oh my God, I can't behave The worse they are The better they taste  One little bite couldn't hurt, right? I'ma get what I deserve, right? I'm done with playing it safe The worse they are The better they taste

Somebody get me a hammer Wanna break all the clocks and the mirrors And go back to a time that was different A time when I didn't feel like there was something missing Now my body and mind are so distant Don't know how to escape from this prison  How can I free my mind?  'Cause I can't breathe I can't breathe I can't breathe I can't breathe I can't breathe Ooh, ooh, ooh I can't breathe  How can I live in the moment When my thoughts never feel like my own and Don't know how to admit that I'm broken  How can I be alright?  'Cause I can't breathe I can't breathe I can't breathe I can't breathe I can't breathe Ooh, ooh, ooh I can't breathe  I can't breathe I can't breathe I can't breathe I can't breathe

We met at a concert, you were Wearing converse, I'm not good at playing it cool. You said I was funny, I spent all my money, Then your friend got thrown in the pool. When we said goodbye, Know that I can't lie, I never thought I'd see you again. Man was I mistaken, Now my heart is taken, It's too hard to comprehend.  That I'm falling, Hoping that you feel this way too. Said I'm falling, Sitting here waiting for you.  Expert of illusion, I just kept to using, Thought I had it all worked out. Love was just a stage name, Watched it as it became, Something I could live without. Then to my surprise, you opened my eyes, I thought I was empty inside. Now every time your near, Stormy skies become clear, Now there's nowhere left to hide.  And I'm falling... Hoping that you feel this way too. Said I'm falling, Sitting here waiting for you.  Said I'm falling, Hoping that you feel this way too. Said I'm falling, Sitting here waiting for you.  Falling, Hoping that you feel this way too.

Because you've been so kind, such an orderly decline After what I put you through. With a smile on your face, and an angel's grace You took this all in stride. And just like they say, every good thing goes away It's only a matter of time.  You say that it is hard for you to tell me The things you know that I don't want to hear. But I will be goddamned if I will let me Let you take my heart and disappear  Well I sit back wondering how it is you helped me Get away with all my foolishness. And I will be goddamned if I will let me

Everybody wants to be famous Nobody wants to be nameless, aimless People act shameless Tryna live like entertainers Want a fat crib with the acres So they spend money that they ain't made yet Got a Benz on tik that they ain't paid yet Spend their pay cheque In the west end on the weekend Got no money by the end of the weekend But they don't care 'cause their life is a movie Starring Louis V, paid for by yours truly Truthfully, it's a joke, like a bad episode of hollyoaks Can't keep up with the cover notes So they got bad credit livin' on direct debit In debt but they still don't get 'Cause they too busy livin' the high life, the night life Huggin' the high way, livin' large And they all say  Sometimes it seems that the going is just too rough And things go wrong no matter what I do Now and then it seems that life is just too much But you've got the love I need to see me through  Let me take you down to London city Where the attitudes bad and the weather is shitty Everybody's on the paper chase, its one big rat race Everybody got a screw face So many too fake Checking the height, they say they ready to ride I'm on the inside looking at the outside So it's a accurate reflection City wide north east west and the south side Everywhere I go there's a girl on the corner Guns and drugs got the city like a sauna And it's getting warmer and out of order Trying to put a struggling mother to a morner Mr politician can you tell me the solution What's the answer what's the conclusion Is it an illusion Is it a mirage I see youngers dying 'cause their tryna live large? And they all say  Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air I know I can count on you Sometimes I feel like saying "Lord I just don't care" But you've got the love I need to see me through  You got the love You got the love You got the love You got the love You got the love You got the love  We are livin' in the days of the credit crunch Give me the doh I'm trying have a bunch But I can't have rice for lunch It's not there ain't enough to share Ain't fair never dreamed that he could be rare Who cares who dares to make a change Everybody in the club trying to make it rain But not for famine just for the sake of habit 15 minutes of fame and everything's the same Again and again I see the same thing Everybody acting like they their plane sailin' I see rough seas ahead maybe a recession And then a depression in whatever profession This is my confession I can't fight I'm in the forefront Living for money ready to start like a bungee jump With no rope but I ain't trying to see the bottom Because that's were I came from, I ain't forgotten  You got the love You got the love You got the love You got the love You got the love You got the love  Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air I know I can count on you Sometimes I feel like saying "Lord I just don't care"

I can almost remember their funny faces That time you told 'em that you were going to be marrying soon And Jet I thought the only lonely place was on the moon   Was your father as bold as a sergeant major?

They say an end can be a start Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive It's like a bad day that never ends I feel the chaos around me A thing I don't try to deny I'd better learn to accept that There are things in my life I can't control  They say love ain't nothing but a sore I don't even know what love is Too many tears have had to fall Don't you know I'm so tired of it all I have known terror dizzy spells Finding out the secrets words won't tell Whatever it is it can't be named There's a part of my world that's fading away  You know I don't want to be clever To be brilliant or superior True like ice, true like fire Now I know that a breeze can blow me away Now I know there's much more dignity In defeat than in the brightest victory I'm losing my balance on the tight rope Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please...  If I ever feel better Remind me to spend some good time with you You can give me your number When it's all over I'll let you know  Hang on to the good days I can lean on my friends They help me going through hard times But I'm feeding the enemy I'm in league with the foe Blame me for what's happening I can't try, I can't try, I can't try...  No one knows the hard times I went through If happiness came I miss the call The stormy days ain't over I've tried and lost know I think that I pay the cost Now I've watched all my castles fall They were made of dust, after all Someday all this mess will make me laugh I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait...  If I ever feel better Remind me to spend some good time with you You can give me your number When it's all over I'll let you know  If I ever feel better Remind me to spend some good time with you You can give me your number When it's all over I'll let you know  It's like somebody took my place I ain't even playing my own game The rules have changed well I didn't know There are things in my life I can't control I feel the chaos around me A thing I don't try to deny I'd better learn to accept that There's a part of my life that will go away  Dark is the night, cold is the ground In the circular solitude of my heart As one who strives a hill to climb I am sure I'll come through I don't know how They say an end can be a start Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive  I'm losing my balance on the tight rope Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please...  If I ever feel better Remind me to spend some good time with you You can give me your number When it's all over I'll let you know  If I ever feel better Remind me to spend some good time with you You can give me your number When it's all over I'll let you know  If I ever feel better Remind me to spend some good time with you You can give me your number When it's all over I'll let you know

Sometimes, I don't know if I'm there... Sometimes, I don't know if I feel... Sometimes, I don't know if I'm real...

They come from every state to find Some dreams were meant to be declined Tell the man what did you have in mind What have you come to do?  No turning water into wine No learning while you're in the line I'll take you to the broken sign You see these lights are blue  Come and get it, lost it at the city limit Say goodbye 'cause they will find a way to trim it Everybody looking for a silly gimmick Gotta get away, can't take it for another minute  This town is made of many things Just look at what the current brings So high it's only promising This place was made on you  Tell me baby, what's your story? Where you come from and where you want to go this time, aw Tell me lover, are you lonely? The thing we need is never all that hard to find, aw  Tell me baby, what's your story? Where do you come from and where you want to go this time, aw You're so lovely, are you lonely? Oh, giving up on the innocence you left behind  Some claim to have the fortitude Too shrewd to blow the interlude Sustaining pain to set a mood Step out to be reviewed  I'll move you like a baritone Jungle brothers on the microphone Getting over with an undertone It's time to turn to stone  Chitty chitty baby when your nose is in the nitty gritty Life could be a little sweet but life could be a little shitty What a pity, Boston and a Kansas City Lookin' for a hundred but you only ever found a fitty  Three fingers in the honeycomb You ring just like a xylophone Devoted to the chromosome The day that you left home  Tell me baby, what's your story? Where you come from and where you want to go this time, aw Tell me lover, are you lonely? The thing we need is never all that hard to find, aw  Tell me baby, what's your story Where you come from and where you want to go this time, aw You're so lovely, are you lonely? Oh, giving up on the innocence you left behind (behind)  Tell me baby, what's your story? Where you come from and where you want to go this time, aw Tell me lover, are you lonely? The thing we need is never all that hard to find, aw  Tell me baby, what's your story? Where you come from and where you want to go this time, aw You're so lovely, are you lonely? Oh, giving up on the innocence you left behind
Baby, here we are, Waiting here for time, to play the game Let love steal us away  Baby here I am, holding charts To guide us through the storm, To a brighter day  You and I will be together, Many lessons, learned, oh baby From a past, that's lived too many lies. Yesterday is gone forever--there's tomorrow, All that I can see  You and I living together Just, you and I groovin' forever  Trusting every word,  Just to mean, what has been handed down, In time We've known hurt before  Masters of my dreams,  Create a place to feel this love of mine And never hurt no more  You and I living together Just, you and I groovin' forever  We must trust the dark, For showing us the stars We must trust the rain,  And open up our hearts  Just, you and I living together. You and I groovin' forever.
I want you by my side So that I never feel alone again They've always been so kind But now they've brought you away from me  I hope they didn't get your mind Your heart is too strong anyway We need to fetch back the time They have stolen from us  And I want you We can bring it on the floor You've never danced like this before We don't talk about it Dancing on Do the boogie all night long You're stoned in paradise Shouldn't talk about it  And I want you We can bring it on the floor You've never danced like this before We don't talk about it Dancing on Do the boogie all night long You're stoned in paradise Shouldn't talk about it Shouldn't talk about it  Coldest winter for me No sun is shining anymore The only thing I feel is pain Caused by absence of you  Suspense controlled in my mind I cannot find the way outta here I want you by my side So that I never feel alone again  And I want you We can bring it on the floor You've never danced like this before We don't talk about it Dancing on Do the boogie all night long You're stoned in paradise Shouldn't talk about it  And I want you We can bring it on the floor You've never danced like this before We don't talk about it Dancing on Do the boogie all night long You're stoned in paradise Shouldn't talk about it Shouldn't talk about it  And I want you We can bring it on the floor You've never danced like this before We don't talk about it Dancing on Do the boogie all night long You're stoned in paradise Shouldn't talk about it  And I want you We can bring it on the floor You've never danced like this before We don't talk about it Dancing on Do the boogie all night long You're stoned in paradise Shouldn't talk about it Shouldn't talk about it
